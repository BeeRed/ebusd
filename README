ebus Daemon (ebusd) - README
============================

ebus (energy bus) is a serial communication protocoll used in heating systems. 


Features:
=========

 * ebus - send and receive ebus commands
   - send Broadcast (BC), Master-Master (MM) and Master-Slave (MS) messages
   - calculate CRC for sending data and check CRC of received data
   - not allowed byte sequences inside data will be escaped and unescaped
   - it saved data from specified cycle messages
   
 * telnet - multi telnet session (listen on TCP port 8888)
   The available commands are different of each heating system and provider.
   This commands are defined in csv files which will be parsed on daemon startup.
   
   Commands:
   - get        send message (BC, MM or MS) to slave and decoded received answer
   - set        send data to the slave with the intention to adjust this value
   - cyc        return data from collected cycle messages
   - loglevel   change loglevel at runtime
   - quit       disconnect from daemon
   - shutdown   stop daemon
